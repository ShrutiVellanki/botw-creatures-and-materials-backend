# Breath of the Wild API

[Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) features a vast world full of monsters, creatures and raw materials that can be used for recipes, elixirs, armour upgrades and health benefits to the player.

It can be difficult to keep track of all these items, where they are found, what effects they give and how to retrieve them...which is where my API comes in.
